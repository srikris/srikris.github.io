== Abstract
Many problems in machine learning can be solved by rounding the solution of an
appropriate linear program (LP). This paper shows that we can recover solutions
of comparable quality by rounding an approximate LP solution instead of the ex-
act one. These approximate LP solutions can be computed efficiently by applying
a parallel stochastic-coordinate-descent method to a quadratic-penalty
formulation of the LP. We derive worst-case runtime and solution quality
guarantees of this scheme using novel perturbation and convergence analysis.
Our experiments demonstrate that on such combinatorial problems as vertex
cover, independent set and multiway-cut, our approximate rounding scheme is up
to an order of magnitude faster than Cplex (a commercial LP solver) while
producing solutions of similar quality.
